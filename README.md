# SE_950
So I read lately this article https://techmaniacs.gr/kai-omos-akoysan-kati-ston-ari-apodeixi-oti-den-imastan-monoi/   which I think it  was intresting and I got intrested on running an average colour distribution analysis on SE 950 ![SE_950](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d88d6b5-5996-45f6-b496-724a476dbe68)
and an edge detection analyses and Contour analyses and those are the results.
